/**
 * @file main.c
 * @brief Main entry point for the AEB system simulation.
 *
 * @overview
 * This program simulates an Automated Emergency Braking (AEB) system in a
 * multi-threaded embedded C environment. The simulation models a vehicle with
 * dynamic speed and obstacle detection capabilities using sensor data. The
 * system's key components are:
 *
 * - Sensor Modules: Simulated sensors include an ultrasonic sensor (for
 * obstacle distance), a speed sensor (for vehicle speed), and a brake pressure
 * sensor.
 *
 * - AEB Logic: Based on the sensor readings, the AEB system determines
 * whether to engage or release the brakes. When an obstacle is detected within
 * a critical distance (less than 2.0 m) and the vehicle is moving, the system
 * applies the brakes.
 *
 * - Input Handling: A dedicated thread processes user input in non-blocking
 * mode. Users can simulate different driving scenarios:
 *      - Press 'a' to simulate an imminent accident (obstacle distance set
 * to 1.0 m).
 *      - Press 'n' to return to normal driving (obstacle distance reset to
 * 100.0 m).
 *      - Press 'q' to quit the simulation.
 *
 * - Dynamic Motion Simulation: The vehicle's speed is dynamically adjusted:
 *      - Under normal conditions, the speed fluctuates randomly within a
 * defined range.
 *      - When brakes are applied, the vehicle decelerates rapidly but does not
 * fall below a minimum speed threshold.
 *
 * - Multi-Threading and Object Pattern: The system utilizes separate
 * threads for input processing and system updates. It follows the Object
 * Pattern by encapsulating all system state within an AEBSystem structure and
 * ensuring thread safety with mutex locking.
 *
 * The main function initializes the system, starts the threads, and cleans up
 * resources upon exit.

/**
 * @brief Thread function for updating the AEB system state and simulating
 * vehicle motion.
 *
 * This function continuously updates the AEB system by:
 *  - Locking the system state for thread-safe access.
 *  - Checking the exit flag to terminate the thread when required.
 *  - Calling aeb_system_update() to process sensor inputs and apply/release
 * brakes.
 *  - Simulating vehicle motion:
 *      - If brakes are applied, the vehicle decelerates quickly (but not below
 * a minimum speed).
 *      - If brakes are not applied, the vehicle speed is randomly adjusted
 * within a defined range.
 *  - Copying sensor data locally and printing the system status.
 *  - Sleeping for 500 milliseconds before the next update cycle.
 *
 * @param arg Pointer to an AEBSystem instance.
 * @return Always returns NULL.
