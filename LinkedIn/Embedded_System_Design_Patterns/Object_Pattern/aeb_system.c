 * system.

 * This module defines the initialization and operational logic for an AEB
 * system using an object-oriented approach in C. It updates sensor values,
 * determines whether the braking system should be activated based on sensor
 * inputs, and applies or releases the brakes accordingly.

 *  - Clearing the exit flag (used for thread termination).
 *  - Initializing sensor values:
 *      - Ultrasonic sensor is set to 100.0 meters to indicate no obstacle.
 *      - Speed sensor is set to 20.0 m/s as the initial vehicle speed.
 *      - Brake pressure sensor is set to 0.0 PSI, indicating brakes are not
 * applied.
